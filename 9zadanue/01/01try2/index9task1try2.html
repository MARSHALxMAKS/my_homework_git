                    <p>This happened, indeed, to the train in wich Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve
                        o'clock a
                        troop of ten or twelve thousand
                        head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                        slackening
                        its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too
                        great.
                        The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil qait, untering now and then deafening
                        bellowings.
                        There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                        moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
                        contain.

                <div>
                    <p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg,
                        who had the
                        most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it
                        should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. Passepartout was furious at the delay they
                        occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

                    <p> "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession,
                        just as if they
                        were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                        programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of
                        beasts!"

‚ùù The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.
