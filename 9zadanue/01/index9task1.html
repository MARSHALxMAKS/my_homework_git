                    <p class="p1">This happened, indeed, to the train in wich Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve
                        o'clock a
                        troop of ten or twelve thousand
                        head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                        slackening
                        its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too
                        great.
                        The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil qait, untering now and then deafening
                        bellowings.
                        There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                        moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
                        contain.
